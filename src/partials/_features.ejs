    <p>
      Glimmer is one of the fastest DOM rendering engines, delivering
      exceptional performance for initial renders as well as updates.
      Architected like a virtual machine (VM), Glimmer compiles your templates
      into low-level code so it can run as fast as possible—without sacrificing
      ease of use.

    <h2>Versatile Use</h2>

    <p>
      Glimmer components can coexist with your technology stack, so you can develop new features in Glimmer
      components without rewriting existing code.

    <h2>Battle Tested</h2>

    <p>
      Because Glimmer VM powers the components in Ember, there’s a battle-tested,
      full-stack framework waiting for you—if you need it. Just drop your
      Glimmer components into an Ember app. You won’t need to change a thing.
